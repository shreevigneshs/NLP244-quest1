### Glove Embeddings
Follow the .ipynb notebook glove/glove-pre-processing.ipynb to do the pre-processing for using glove embeddings so it can be consumed by gensim. It requires gensim so pip install gensim.

### Training with data loaders
Follow the training_with_dataloaders.ipynb file which contains the complete data preparation + training script. It requires the glove embeddings so prior to run ing the script follow glove/glove-pre-processing.ipynb to get preprocessed glove embeddings in gensim format.
